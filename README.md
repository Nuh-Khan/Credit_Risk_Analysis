# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Suprervised Machine Learning with Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the Credit Risk analysis
Credit risk poses an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans significantly outnumber risky loans. Various techniques have been employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. A range of libraries and algorithms have been utilized for building and assessing models using resampling, including:

* Imbalanced-learn
* Scikit-learn
* RandomOverSampler
* SMOTE algorithms
* ClusterCentroids algorithm
* SMOTEENN algorithm
* BalancedRandomForestClassifier (bias reduction model)
* EasyEnsembleClassifier (bias reduction model)

### Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be applied in data analytics. This involves creating training and test groups from a given data set and implementing various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine. The results of these algorithms will be interpreted, and the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm will be compared. This analysis will also help in determining the most suitable supervised learning algorithm for a specific data set or scenario. Furthermore, ensemble and resampling techniques will be employed to enhance model performance.
